Flow control structures are an essential part of programming in C. They dictate the flow of execution of instructions within a program, allowing for complex decision-making, looping, and branching. These structures include conditional statements, loops, and jump statements. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at each type with examples. ### 1. Conditional Statements #### `if` Statement The `if` statement allows the program to execute certain sections of code only if a specified condition is true. ```c #include int main() { int number = 10; if (number > 5) { printf("Number is greater than 5.\n"); } return 0; } ``` #### `if-else` Statement The `if-else` statement provides an alternative path of execution when the condition is false. ```c #include int main() { int number = 3; if (number > 5) { printf("Number is greater than 5.\n"); } else { printf("Number is 5 or less.\n"); } return 0; } ``` #### `else if` Ladder The `else if` ladder allows multiple conditional branches. ```c #include int main() { int number = 7; if (number > 10) { printf("Number is greater than 10.\n"); } else if (number > 5) { printf("Number is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10.\n"); } else { printf("Number is 5 or less.\n"); } return 0; } ``` #### `switch` Statement The `switch` statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases). ```c #include int main() { int choice = 2; switch (choice) { case 1: printf("Choice is 1.\n"); break; case 2: printf("Choice is 2.\n"); break; case 3: printf("Choice is 3.\n"); break; default: printf("Invalid choice.\n"); break; } return 0; } ``` ### 2. Loops #### `while` Loop The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. ```c #include int main() { int i = 1; while (i <= 5) { printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); i++; } return 0; } ``` #### `do-while` Loop The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once. ```c #include int main() { int i = 1; do { printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); i++; } while (i <= 5); return 0; } ``` #### `for` Loop The `for` loop is the most commonly used loop in C. It includes initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in a single line. ```c #include int main() { for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); } return 0; } ``` ### 3. Jump Statements #### `break` Statement The `break` statement terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch. ```c #include int main() { for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { if (i == 3) { break; // loop is terminated when i equals 3 } printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); } return 0; } ``` #### `continue` Statement The `continue` statement skips the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds with the next iteration. ```c #include int main() { for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { if (i == 3) { continue; // skips the rest of the loop body when i equals 3 } printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); } return 0; } ``` #### `goto` Statement The `goto` statement transfers control to the labeled statement. It is generally discouraged due to readability issues and potential for creating "spaghetti code." ```c #include int main() { int i = 1; start: printf("Value of i: %d\n", i); i++; if (i <= 5) { goto start; } return 0; } ``` Understanding and effectively using these flow control structures allows for the creation of dynamic, responsive, and efficient programs in C.
